    "In this assignment, you'll be working with messy medical data and using regex to extract relevant infromation from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each line of the `dates.txt` file corresponds to a medical note. Each note has a date that needs to be extracted, but each date is encoded in one of many formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to correctly identify all of the different date variants encoded in this dataset and to properly normalize and sort the dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of some of the variants you might encounter in this dataset:\n",
    "* 04/20/2009; 04/20/09; 4/20/09; 4/3/09\n",
    "* Mar-20-2009; Mar 20, 2009; March 20, 2009;  Mar. 20, 2009; Mar 20 2009;\n",
    "* 20 Mar 2009; 20 March 2009; 20 Mar. 2009; 20 March, 2009\n",

    "* 6/2008; 12/2009\n",
    "* 2009; 2010\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have extracted these date patterns from the text, the next step is to sort them in ascending chronological order accoring to the following rules:\n",
    "* Assume all dates in xx/xx/xx format are mm/dd/yy\n",
    "* Assume all dates where year is encoded in only two digits are years from the 1900's (e.g. 1/5/89 is January 5th, 1989)\n",
    "* If the day is missing (e.g. 9/2009), assume it is the first day of the month (e.g. September 1, 2009).\n",
    "* If the month is missing (e.g. 2010), assume it is the first of January of that year (e.g. January 1, 2010).\n",
    "* Watch out for potential typos as this is a raw, real-life derived dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these rules in mind, find the correct date in each note and return a pandas Series in chronological order of the original Series' indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example if the original series was this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0    1999\n",
    "    1    2010\n",

    "    3    2015\n",
    "    4    1985\n",

Similar physiological and psychological symptoms were reported as above. The third episode occurred recently on 6/29/81.

He recently left a job at jacobs engineering group where he worked for about 5 years. He started working at becton dickinson a few weeks ago.

He was having suicidal thoughts the week of 8/22/83 and noticed that his depression and anxiety symptoms were starting to interfere with work. Per Dr. Ford's recommendation, he contacted PAL for assistance. When screened for substance use, pt was referred to SMH for an intake. Pt was scheduled to be seen last week due to urgency of his depression and SI, but missed the intake appointment due to getting extremely intoxicated the night before.

She is seeking help mainly around management of anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent alcohol (which she has not consumed since May 2016) is affecting her current situation.  Biological factors include likely primary mood and/or anxiety disorders (perhaps depression with panic attacks), consequences of long-term alcohol use. Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times. Her social situation reflects isolation and an unfortunately high level of dependence on her children.  One important challenge is her discomfort with opening up and seeking care, which may benefit from positive treatment alliances.\n",
